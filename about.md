Hello, and thanks for visiting my blog! I am Eddy Lin, an undergraduate student at Duke University studying Math and Computer Science.

### Computer Vision

Since taking COMPSCI 527 - Computer Vision with Prof. Carlo Tomasi, I have been fascinated by the diverse applications of Computer Vision & AI, so I hope to implement some of the things I've learned in simple, fun projects!

### Team Fortress 2

I'm unashamed to say that I have over 1,200 hours actively in-game on Team Fortress 2 with almost 600 hours of active play with my favorite class: Spy! This character is a unique class, as he is awarded a single-hit elimination upon stabbing an enemy player in the back. Over the years, playing spy has helped me develop intuition as a player on others' playstyles and movements, as well as how to counter those movements. For a demonstration on how much thinking can go behind this stuff, here is a link to my favorite 4+ hour tutorial on countering other player's strafe - a type of movement using the 'A' and 'D' keys (left and right): [CulRulDud's Circlestrafing Tutorial](https://youtu.be/jEXA6vKsTcE).

This type of mechanic has always fascinated me, and I have brought my learnings to other first-person shooter games that I've played. Being able to classify the basic movements and psychologies of the players I meet as falling into a certain category has never ceased to amaze me, as prediction can become easier, and you can perform a certain "magic".
