Hello, and welcome to my very first blog post... ever! I hope to document and showcase my learning to people who are curious in the learning and projects I am doing. For now, I am still just a beginner, so I hope to start implementing basic projects in computer vision to get a grasp of the fundamentals!

### Upcoming Team Fortress 2 Project:

For my first project, I will be implementing some basic algorithms I have learned about using PyTorch in Team Fortress 2 (TF2) video footage. Deciding to use this game was an easy choice, as I have gained a deep familiarity with its structure and gameplay throughout the years (see my [About Page](https://eddyleelin.github.io/about/)). Inspired by work from OpenAI and Google's DeepMind, I believe games give a unique perspective of the real world, pitting teams of players against each other to battle towards an objective. Perhaps, this 3D computer-generated world will bring me some insights into computer vision, modeling human behaviors and intelligence, and even into our own world. _Plus, it also gives me a fun excuse to explore a game from my childhoold!_

**But why are you using a game, which is useless to real life?**

This is a fair question, and I have asked that myself a couple times since starting the project. I believe the struggle of applying the computer vision techniques to an environment where pre-built models are not built for (such as YOLO and other architectures built to detect real-world objects) is what will give me the opportunity to explore the deeper *frustrations* (and thus, learning) that is required to build these architectures from an earlier point.

### How I'll Be Tackling This Project

At first, I will start small, learning the basics of the PyTorch framework, while I try to expand my knowledge and implement more and more! I've had some ideas so far, such as using deep learning to achieve the following:

- Object detection
- Segmentation
- Depth perception
- 3D reconstruction & mapping players
- Motion tracking
- Player motion prediction
